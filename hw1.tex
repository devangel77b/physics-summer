\begin{questions}
\question Typical problems (from \citet{hecht2018schaums})
\begin{parts}
\part A toy train moves along a winding track at an average speed of \SI{0.25}{\meter\per\second}. How far will it travel in \SI{4.00}{\minute}?
\part A student driving a car travels \SI{10.0}{\kilo\meter} in \SI{30.0}{\minute}. What was her average speed?
\part A model plane flew \SI{100}{\meter} in \SI{25.0}{\second} followed by another \SI{240}{\meter} in an additional \SI{60.0}{\second}, whereupon it crashed into the ground. How far did it travel in total? How long was it in the air? What was its average speed?

\question\label{q:2} Xuan the guide dog puppy is riding in a 2000 Ford Ranger. He records his position versus time as shown in \fref{fig:q2}. Develop an appropriate equation for Xuan's position $x(t)$, velocity $v(t)$ and acceleration $a(t)$; write the equations and graph all three. Discuss some issues you may have in estimating the velocity and acceleration.

\question We developed expressions for $x(t)$, $v(t)$ and $a(t)$ for the case of constant velocity motion. Develop the same for the case of \textbf{constant acceleration}. 
\begin{parts}
\part What is $a(t)$ for \textbf{constant} acceleration? (not a trick question)
\part\label{part:3b} What is $v(t)$? You may find this by finding the area under the $a(t)$ curve, or by using the integral. Recall that for $f(t)=at^b$, $\frac{df}{dt}=bat^{b-1}$, and $\int f dt = \frac{a}{b+1} t^{b+1}+C_1$, where $C_1$ is the constant of integration. 
\part What is $x(t)$? Again, you may find this by finding the area under the $v(t)$ curve, or by using the integral. Recall that for $f(t)=at^b$, $\frac{df}{dt}=bat^{b-1}$, and $\int f dt = \frac{a}{b+1} t^{b+1}+C_2$, where $C_2$ is the constant of integration. Try to do whichever one you didn't do during part~\ref{part:3b}. You will have a different constant of integration. 
\part Sketch all three functions $a(t)$, $v(t)$ and $x(t)$. How does your sketch change for different values of $C_1$ and $C_2$. What are the units of the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$, and what do they represent?. 
\part Check your results by finding the slope (or derivatives) of $x(t)$ and $v(t)$. Try both. 
\end{parts}

\question You move to LA and get a job at NASA JPL working on a small, zero G robot propelled with compressed air, able to move around inside the International Space Station. You are planning a set of commands to transmit to the robot for an upcoming flight test on a ``Vomit Comet'' C-9B microgravity simulator plane. 

\begin{parts}
\part The first test maneuver is to fly up \SI{1}{\meter} in \SI{1}{\second}, hover for \SI{1}{\second}, then return to the launch point in \SI{1}{\second}. Sketch the vertical position and velocity of the robot. You will need this to construct velocity commands to send to the robot, and to set failsafe limits on position in its autonomous flight controller.
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}
\part During the actual test, a failure occurs in the propulsion system, resulting in the throttle valve being stuck open during the first part of the maneuver (heading upwards). With the failed valve, the force on the robot is \SI{10}{\newton} and its mass is \SI{1}{\kilo\gram}. Please plot the robot's position versus time. The far wall of the test chamber is \SI{10}{\meter} away; show when it hits the wall on your graph. Assume the robot is streamlined so that air resistance is small and neglect any change in mass from the expulsion of propellant.  
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}
\part To think about design changes in case of another similar failure, we need to know how long the robot has to respond, and how bad it is when it hits. Please compute the time to hitting the wall, and the speed when it hits. 
\begin{solution}
\end{solution}
